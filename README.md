Crawl and analyze the authors' information from douban.book

My python version is Python 3.6.3

To get authors' information from douban.book you should run the code in this order:
1.get_book.py               in this step you will get book_test.txt
2.get_authorID.py           in this step you will get author_id.txt
3.getAuthorsCSV.py          in this step you will get author.csv

Then you can use these data for analysisï¼Œor use the data I get.
